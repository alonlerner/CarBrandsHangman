# CarBrandsHangman
This project is a hangman game of car brands that is played in a Python console.
The game chooses a random car brand from text file that is used as the database and prints asterisks instead of its letters.
The player needs to guess letters until the car brand is revealed.
The player's goal is to reveale the car brand with 5 or fewer missed guesses.
In the end, the game prints if the player won or lost, the number of seconds it took, and the number of missed guesses.
